# Database Development Process

This document describes the steps followed to design the database for the **Study Plan Manager** project. Each step includes a link to the corresponding file where its content is detailed.

## Development Process Stages

### 1. Conceptual Description
In this initial stage, the overall purpose of the database is defined, and the main elements and requirements that must be met are identified. It includes descriptions of the data the system will handle, its main characteristics, and how they relate to the projectâ€™s goals.

### 2. Entity-Relationship Model
In this stage, a graphical model is created to represent the main entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. This model serves as the foundation for logically structuring and organizing the data in the database.

### 3. Relational Model
In this final stage, the entity-relationship model is translated into a relational schema. This includes defining tables, columns, data types, primary and foreign keys, as well as any constraints necessary to ensure data integrity.
